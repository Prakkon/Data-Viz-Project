# Visualizing Human Migration Patterns and Trafficking in South Asia and South-East Asia


#### Hello reader! If you are going to use it as inspiration for your projects, please feel free to do so! This is a project based on machine learning, data visualizations and time series analysis

Note:
- Project added on 10th of June, 2021
- This repository contains my college project on Data Visualization
- I go by the name Prakhar, and I'm most likely to improve this work as time passes. I've made some initial commits, and I will be adding changes with time :)

I'll be adding patch notes with time for each commit as long as I feel there's room for improvement (at the time of it's creation, yes, there's a lot of room!)
